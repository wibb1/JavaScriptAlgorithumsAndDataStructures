# =================================================
# Sliding Window
# =================================================

* This pattern involves creating a *window* which can either be an array or number from one position to another
* Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
* Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

Best used when we have an array or string where it has a subset that we are looking to find

finding the longest string of unique characters in "hellothere" => lother

*The sliding window needs to have a temp and final answer. It needs to compare them to replace the final anaswer*

## =================================================
## Max Subarray Sum
## =================================================

Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called *n*. The function should calculate the maximum sum of *n* consecutive elements in the array.
