### Multiple Pointers
### ===========================================

Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the begining end or middle based on a certain condition.

**Very** efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

#### Multiple Pointers - First Example - SumZero
Write a function called sumZero that accepts a **sorted** array of integers. The function should find the **first** pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

My first take is very similar to his and my refactored solution is very similar to his refactored solution

#### Multiple Pointers - Second Example - CountUniqueValues
Implement a functin called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array and cunts the unique values in the arrat. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.

I like my initial refactored solution the best
