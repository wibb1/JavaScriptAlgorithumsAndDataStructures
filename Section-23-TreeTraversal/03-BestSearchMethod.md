# Breadth V Depth 
Depth and Breadth search both have the same time complexity beacuse they are both visiting every node.

Breadth Search requires a lot of data storage on a wide tree, but is better on a thin tree
Depth first search is better on a wide tree

# Depth First

## In-Order
Returns the values in order from smallest (left) to largest (right)

## Pre-Order or Post-Order
Duplicating or cloning a tree to store for later use.
