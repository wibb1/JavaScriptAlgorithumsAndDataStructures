# Traversing a Tree
There are two ways to traverse a tree:

- **Breadth-first Search (BFS)** - working across the tree (left-right / right-left)
- **Depth-first Search (DFS)** - multiple versions of this type of search
    - **In-Order** - starts on the bottom left and moves right and up
    - **Pre-Order** - starts at the root and searches down the branches
    - **Post-Order** - starts at the bottom and goes up
